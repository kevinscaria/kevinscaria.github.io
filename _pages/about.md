I am an Applied Scientist at Amazon Alexa, where I work on building responsible AI guardrails for large language models (LLMs) and conducting research on mitigating security vulnerabilities in large action models (LAMs), including prompt injection and indirect attack vectors.

My work focuses on model alignment, safety, and runtime policy enforcement, spanning post-training of language models, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and multi-agent control systems for trust and safety at scale.

I completed my MS in Information Technology from The Polytechnic School, Arizona State University. 
I was a research volunteer working with Prof. [Chitta Baral](https://www.public.asu.edu/~cbaral/) and Prof. [Paulo Shakarian](https://search.asu.edu/profile/2424157). 
I closely collaborate with Dr. [Swaroop Mishra](https://swarooprm.github.io/) and Dr. [Arindam Mitra](https://ari9dam.github.io/).

Research
======
My research interests include Post Training, LLM Reasoning, LLM Security, Instruction Tuning, Creation & Curation of Benchmarks, 
and Model Efficiency. 
My strength lies in generating new ideas, and I am fortunate to collaborate with a diverse set of awesome researchers.
